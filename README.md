# Smart-Sign-Detection-System
 Project Description:
Developed a Smart Sign Detection System that automatically identifies and classifies various signs (e.g., traffic signs or hand gestures) using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system leverages image processing and deep learning to detect signs in real-time from video streams or static images.

Implemented using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras, the model was trained on a labeled dataset to recognize different sign categories. Applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification, achieving high accuracy in real-world scenarios. Integrated the system with a simple user interface to demonstrate real-time sign detection capabilities.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Real-time sign detection using webcam or input images

CNN-based model for accurate classification

Preprocessing techniques like grayscale conversion, edge detection, and contour analysis

High-accuracy prediction and performance optimization

Optional alert/message system upon sign detection
